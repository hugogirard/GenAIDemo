    "\n",
    "Welcome to this notebook! In this notebook, we will be using the official OpenAI SDK in Python to interact with OpenAI's powerful language models. The SDK provides a simple and efficient way to access the capabilities of OpenAI's models, enabling us to perform a variety of tasks such as text generation, completion, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's install the OpenAI SDK. You can do this using pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the SDK is installed, you can start using it in your Python code. Set your OpenAI API key and make requests to the OpenAI API to get responses from the language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information on how to use the OpenAI SDK, please refer to the official documentation.\n",

      "        \"content\": \"Sure! Here are 5 funny and light-hearted facts about Quebec City:\\n\\n1. **Unmistakable Loophole for Winter Weather**: Quebecers love to joke about their relationship with cold weather. Since winters are so harsh, there’s a saying that \\\"If you can survive a Quebec winter, you’re ready for any apocalypse.\\\" It’s worn as a badge of honor, but locals also find humor in how tourists show up grossly unprepared—rocking sneakers in six feet of snow!\\n\\n2. **The Endless Poutine Debate**: Quebec City residents take their poutine seriously, but you’d be surprised how intense and hilarious the debate gets about which restaurant makes the *ultimate* poutine. People will passionately argue whether it's the squeakiness of the cheese curds or the gravy texture that truly makes or breaks it, with some local spots claiming their poutine is nothing short of a masterpiece!\\n\\n3. **Beware of the Bonhomme de Neige!**: The famous Bonhomme Carnaval is the mascot of the Quebec Winter Carnival, but here’s the funny part: some kids find him downright terrifying. While tourists eagerly take selfies, many local children have a “feverish respect” for the giant snowman, whispering legends of his magical powers! Who’s to say a walking snowman isn’t a bit creepy?\\n\\n4. **An Obsession with the Château Frontenac**: Quebec City is home to the Château Frontenac, often called the \\\"most photographed hotel in the world.\\\" Locals will jokingly tell you that every single tourist photo includes this iconic landmark—even accidentally. Some even claim that the city has a law where you’re required to take at least one photo of the Château before you're allowed to leave!\\n\\n5. **Escargot? Mais, Non!**: Tourists sometimes think Quebec City’s cuisine is super fancy and assume everyone eats escargot (snails) and foie gras every day. Locals love to chuckle at this stereotype, jokingly telling visitors, “We only eat escargot when poutine isn’t an option!” Spoiler alert: they’re more likely enjoying a big plate of comfort food than haute cuisine on a casual night.\\n\\nHope these bring a smile to your face! 🎉\",\n",

Here are five funny facts about Quebec City:\\n\\n1. **The \\\"Upside-Down\\\" Cannon**: Near the Plains of Abraham, Quebec City has a cannon that's famously stuck upside down into the ground. Its origins are a mystery, but local kids often joked it was to \\\"shoot at moles.\\\" The odd placement makes it one of the city's strange, unofficial landmarks, perfect for a funny photo op!\\n\\n2. **The \\\"Ice Cream War\\\"**: Quebecers are famously serious about their desserts, so it caused quite a stir when two popular ice cream shops in Old Quebec\\u2014\\u00c9rico and Chocolats Favoris\\u2014had a \\u201csweet rivalry\\u201d over whose ice cream was the best. The \\\"war\\\" may mostly exist in the minds of their fans, but locals love debating ice cream loyalty with dramatic flair.\\n\\n3. **The Poutine Police**: Quebec is the birthplace of poutine, but in Quebec City, locals can be a *little* judgmental about how it's made. Tourists trying to order \\\"healthy\\\" poutine or adding strange toppings (like pineapple!) might face mock gasps of horror from locals who view it as a food crime. Stick to the holy trinity: fries, cheese curds, and gravy.\\n\\n4. **The \\\"Leaning\\\" Ch\\u00e2teau Frontenac**: Though iconic and stunning, some mischievous locals joke that the Ch\\u00e2teau Frontenac has a slight \\\"lean\\\" if you're tipsy. It\\u2019s likely just a trick of your wine-glass-filled imagination, but it\\u2019s a fun excuse to enjoy one (or two) of Quebec's famed ciders or craft beers to \\\"check\\\" the angle.\\n\\n5. **Winter Carnival Canoe Races**: Every winter, Quebec City hosts a wild, icy canoe race across the frozen St. Lawrence River as part of the Winter Carnival. Participants paddle (and sometimes drag) their canoes across chunks of ice in what locals jokingly call \\u201cQuebec\\u2019s version of a spa day.\\u201d It's both hilarious and awe-inspiring to watch.\\n\\nQuebec City definitely knows how to mix history with humor. Whether it's through its quirky landmarks or offbeat traditions, there's always something to make you smile!\"\n",
